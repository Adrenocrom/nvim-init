nvim-init
=========

This is my nvim configuration, which I mainly use for Java development.
Code completion and debugging is working well.
To add a remote debugger a launch.json config is sufficient,
this requires a MainClass and a ProjectName, this is not resolved automatically.

install
-------

    git clone https://github.com/Adrenocrom/nvim-init.git ~/.config/nvim/
